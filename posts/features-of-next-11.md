Here are some of the features introduced in the newer versions of Next.js:

Improved Performance: Next.js 11 introduced a new feature called Automatic Webpack 5 Configuration. It optimizes the build output, reduces build time, and improves overall performance.

Faster Incremental Builds: Incremental Static Regeneration (ISR) is an exciting feature that was added in Next.js 9.5. It allows developers to update static pages at runtime without requiring a full rebuild. This feature has been further optimized in newer versions of Next.js, resulting in even faster incremental builds.

Image Optimization: Next.js 10 introduced Automatic Image Optimization, which allows developers to optimize images for different devices and network conditions. This feature reduces the page load time and improves user experience.

Improved Development Experience: Next.js has added several features to improve the development experience, such as improved TypeScript support, support for React Fast Refresh, and better debugging capabilities.

Improved API Routes: API Routes were introduced in Next.js 9.3, allowing developers to create serverless APIs. Since then, several improvements have been made to API Routes, such as support for dynamic routes and middleware.

Improved Analytics: Next.js 10 introduced a new feature called Automatic Web Vitals Reporting. It automatically reports key performance metrics to Google Analytics, making it easier to monitor and improve website performance.

These are just some of the features that have been introduced in the newer versions of Next.js. The framework is constantly evolving, and new features and improvements are being added regularly.
